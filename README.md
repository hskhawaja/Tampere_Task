This repo contains the code for PDF Summarization task.

A specialized Streamlit application designed to boost your productivity by providing concise summaries of your PDF 
    documents. This app integrates two distinct LLMs — GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 — to deliver accurate and nuanced summaries.

    **How It Works:**\n
    **1. Upload Your PDFs:** Start by uploading a PDF document you need summarized. 
    
    **2. Summarization Models:**
    - GPT-3.5 Turbo
    - GPT-4

    **3. View and Compare Summaries:** The app processes your documents through both models separately and displays the summaries side-by-side, allowing you to compare and derive comprehensive insights swiftly.
